= How do I show the booking form? =

To embed the Simply Schedule Appointments booking calendars on your WordPress pages or posts you can use a shortcode or a page builder module (ex. Elementor Appointment Booking module). You can paste the booking shortcode below using a text box to display all of your appointment types:

`[ssa_booking]`

[Guide on all the ways you can display the Appointment Type Booking Calendars on your site.](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/display-the-booking-calendar/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=display-guide)

= Where can I read the documentation? =

The full documentation is available at [our website](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/help-center/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=help-center).
Or, get started with our [free Basic Edition guide](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/basic-edition-guide/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=basic-edition-guide).

= Will I end up being double-booked? =

Nope. Once a customer has booked an appointment time, that time is no longer available for booking. So you'll never find yourself double-booked.

Additionally, we do some extra checks while a customer is booking an appointment just to be sure their selected time is still available. If someone else books their selected time while they're in the process of booking, we'll let them know and ask them to select another time.

We also offer [Google Calendar syncing in our Plus, Pro, or Business Edition](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/syncing-google-calendar/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=google-calendar) to make sure you never double-book appointments with your personal schedule.

= Can I customize the appearance of the booking form? =

Yes, you can. We offer settings for color and font that will let you customize the form to blend seamlessly into any theme.

[You can additionally add custom CSS to customize the form even further](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/helpful-customization-guides/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=css-customize).

= Are there limitations on the number of booking calendars or appointments I can make? =

No! The free Basic Edition of Simply Schedule Appointments allows you to create an unlimited number of Appointment Types so that you can create a booking calendar for each of your business' services.

And the booking plugin will never limit the number of appointments that you can book.

= Can I test the Simply Schedule Appointments booking calendars before installation? =

Yes, we have a [variety of booking demos](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/demos/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=demos) where you can book test appointments.

= How does Simply Schedule Appointments compare to Calendly? =

We bring all of the great features that people are familiar with in the Calendly scheduling tool. But with the versatility and freedom that WordPress offers.

Compared to Calendly, customers who use Simply Schedule Appointments find that this plugin offers:
* A better range of styling options to match your website
* More ways to mesh the booking calendars into the website workflow through integrations, for example Gravity Forms and MemberPress.
* And, the package tiers are much less complicated — we don't charge by number of team members or number of calendars, it's all unlimited!

= I'm not a developer, can I still set this up? =

Yes of course! The majority of our customers are not developers — setup is really as simple as:
1. Activating the plugin on the site
2. Going through our setup wizard to create your first booking calendar
3. Embedding the calendar on any page or post of your choosing
